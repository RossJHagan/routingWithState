# routingWithState

Demonstrates CycleJS routing while sharing state from parent component with children components.  Sharing state during routing can also be done using the browser's history with pushState which is shown [here](https://github.com/ntilwalli/routingWithPushState).

1. `npm install -g live-server watchify`
2. `npm install`
